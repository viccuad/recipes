Paella (Dad's recipe)
======

5 servings

### Ingredients

* Olive oil (extra virgin)
* 3 garlic cloves
* 1 fresh red pepper
* 500g chicken breasts/wings (100g per person)
* 3/4 tomatoes, as red and ripe as possible, never green
* 500g squid. Clean, without batter
* 200g of shrimps
* 250g of clams, in their shells
* 1 Lemon
* Olives
* 425g Bomba rice: Short-grain rice, that can absorb liquid without breaking itself
* Yellow food coloring (tartrazine, not sweet ones) or saffron
* Mayonnaise
* Olives & boiled egg for decoration

### Preparations

If you have clams, clean them and put them in salty water at room temperature for
some hours. The ones that don't open (even a bit) are dead, throw them away.

Get yourself a big frying pan, the flatter the best, ideally around
30cm of diameter.

If you are going forward with the saffron instead of food coloring, you need to toast it
very gently (if you overdo it, it gets bitter). For that, put it on a frying pan
some seconds, or in the microwave for 10s, or toast it inside an aluminium foil envelope
for some seconds, until a faint of smoke comes out.

### Directions

Cover all the frying pan with 1/2 finger of oil (or even a bit less,
depending on the frying pan).
We are going to slowly and lightly fry every ingredient alone in the oil, and
take it out and reserve it.

Start with the garlic, sliced, until it is golden, and take it out.
Clean the pepper, dry it with paper, slice it in strips, lightly fry it, and take it out.
Do the same with the chicken (and take it out), the squid (and take it out),
the shrimps (and take them out) and clams (and take them out).
Now put the tomatoes, cut in dice, in the oil until they are fried and they disappear.
After that, add everything that was reserved, the olives and meld it.

At this point, add the rice, meld it all well and let the rice soak all the
liquid and the oil.
Add 2 and 1/2 parts of water per the part of rice you added. Put the food
coloring or the saffron on that water (ideally, this water would be from chicken
broth or cooking the seafood, so it has more substance).

It is important to never remove the rice again anymore, because then it will
drop its starch and it will become a risotto.

Let the rice cook over strong heat for 10 mins, slow heat for 10 mins, then cover
the frying pan and let it be for another 10 mins.

Add cut boiled eggs on top for decoration.

Serve each portion sprinkled with a lemon clove and/or a side spoon of
ali-oli (shredded garlic and mayonnaise).
